# Wisconsin Snowmobile Trail Status

A simple web app to view Wisconsin Snowmobile trail information such as whether
the trails in the viewed county are open, the depth of the snow, conditions of
the trails and if they are groomed.

## Instructions

Since this project transpiles ES6+ code to ES5 using babel a build step is necessary,
using the Webpack build system.

To build to project simply run `npm start`. In the event that you wish to watch for
changes and automatically rebuild run `npm run watch` instead.
